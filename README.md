# Vorbi
Vorbi is a simplified social media platform that makes it easy to post and share images with friends and family.  Vorbi gets rid of all the disctracting ads and only shows you the content you want to see.

# Motivation
This was both a project to demonstrate my skills as a full stack developer for my portfolio, and a site that fixed a major problem with social media these days... ads.  While social media platforms use ads to make money, many of their users aren't very fond of the countless ads popping up in their feed.
